\section{Intro Lorenzo}

Object detection is a fundamental and essential part of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. From face recognition to augmented reality or image classification, all algorithms assessing these problems must first be able to find objects in and image and then recognize what they are. In general, any application that requires an algorithm to interact with the outside world through images has to be able to recognize what is seeing in the images it is capturing.

Although many problems related to image recognition have been treated in the past (like number or hand writing recognition), the problem becomes more challenging once we try to address applications where the images fed to the algorithm are more general. In this case, the algorithm not only has to recognize what there is in the image, but also whether there is something and where it is in the image. Not only that, but the model must decide between a wider selection of objects, and images might have different illumination and color characteristics. All of these issues make the problem of image recognition a challenging topic, for which the use of Deep Learning is must.

In this report, we introduce a specific object recognition problem - Pedestrian Detection - and how we assessed a solution for it. Regarding the structure of the report, we will first give some insight in approaches previously taken, then we will talk about the different available datasets and data processing needed, to be followed by our proposed approach and results.
